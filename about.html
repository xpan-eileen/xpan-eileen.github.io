<p>Good day! I am a first-year PhD student under the supervision of <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/thomas/">Dr Adam Thomas</a> and <a href="https://users.monash.edu/~heikod/">Dr Heiko Dietrich</a> (Monash) and am funded by the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/services/dc/policies_guidance/student_mobility/jointphd">Monash Warwick Alliance Joint PhD program</a>. My current project focuses on finite groups of Lie type with broad interests in the computational aspects, linear algebraic groups and representation theory for groups.</p>
