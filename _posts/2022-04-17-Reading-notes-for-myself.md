Currently, I am reading Kleidman's 1985 article *The maximal subgroups of the Chevalley groups $$G_2(q)$$ with $$q$$ odd, the Ree groups $$^2G_2(q)$$, and their automorphism groups.*


For the Chevalley groups over fields with characteristic 2, see Cooperstein's 1981 paper *Maximal subgroups of $G_2(2^n)$.*

## Preliminaries

First recall some notations from abstract group theory. We write $X.Y$ for an extension of $$X$$ by $Y$ ($X$ is normal in this extension). In particilar, $X:Y$ denotes split extensions and $X^.Y$ denotes nonxplit extensions.
