# notes on subgroups and intersections

It is well known that there are 7 (conjugacy) classes of maximal subgroups in the finite exceptional group $G_2(5)$, for example, they are listed in Table 8.14 of the 2013 book *The maximal subgroups of the low-dimensional finite classical groups by* Bray, Holt & Roney-Dougal.

We are interested in the intersections of the such maximal subgroups, which essentially are intersections of double cosets, for which studying $G_2$-actions on cosets is much relevant. The 1988 paper by Lawther and Saxl as well as Lawther’s 1989 paper provide useful insights on this topic.

### Maximal subgroups of type $A_2.2$

A good starting point is to look at the maximal subgroups of type $A_2.2$. These groups are normalisers of the subsystem subgroups of type $A_2$ roots, which can be constructed using the Borel—Siebenthal algorithm. Typically, we have the extended Dynkin diagram consisting of the roots $\alpha, \beta$, and $3\alpha + 2\beta$, and then removing the root $\alpha$ yields an $A_2$ diagram. In Magma this can be easily constructed using the SubsystemSubgroup function; for example:

G := GroupOfLieType(”G2”, 5);

A2:= SubsystemSubgroup(G,{2, 12});

In particular, this subsystem subgroup is isomorphic to $\mathrm{PSL}_3(5)$, with roots $\pm\beta$, $\pm(3\alpha + \beta)$, $\pm(3\alpha + 2\beta)$.

Let $K \cong \mathrm{PSL}_3(5)$ be the subgroup constructed above, Correspondingly, we can find the maximal subgroup of type $A_2.2$ containing $K$ as its normaliser $N_G(H) \cong \mathrm{PSL}_3(5).2$. However, it is hard to directly execute this in Magma for larger groups such as $G_2(7)$, since the Normaliser function becomes rather inefficient. We discuss alternative methods later.

Now we can try to compute some possible intersections $H \cap H^g, K \cap K^g$, for some elements $g \in G$. In the special case where $g = x_\alpha(t)$ with $t \in \mathrm{GF}(5))$ is nonzero), which centralises elements $x_{3\alpha+2\beta}(s) \in H, s \in \mathrm{GF}(5)$, we see that

$$
H \cap H^g = K \cap K^g \cong C_5 \rtimes D_5.\mathrm{Alt}_5.
$$

Since $x_{-\alpha}(t)$ centralises $x_{-3\alpha + 2\beta}(s)$ for all $s, t \in \mathrm{GF}(5)$, the calculation is similar when $g = x_{-\alpha}(t)$ for all nonzero $t$ (when $t = 0, x_r(t)$ is the identity element, and so $H \cap H^g = H, K \cap K^g = K$ for any $g = x_r(0)$, where $r$ is a root).

A routine calculation using the commutator formula tells us that the same is true for all $g = x_r(t)$ for

$$
r \in \{\pm(\alpha + \beta), \pm(2\alpha + \beta)\}.
$$

Calculating in Magma we see that when

$$
\begin{align}
g = x_{\alpha + \beta}(1)x_{2\alpha + \beta}(1), & & H \cap H^g \cong \mathrm{He}(5).2, &\ K \cap K^g \cong \mathrm{He}(5);\\
g = x_{\alpha + \beta}(1)x_{-\alpha - \beta}(s), &\ s = 1 \mbox{ or } 3  & H \cap H^g \cong \mathrm{SL}_2(5).2, &\ K \cap K^g \cong \mathrm{SL}_2(5);\\
g = x_{\alpha + \beta}(1)x_{-\alpha - \beta}(2), & & H \cap H^g \cong Q_8.\mathrm{Alt}_5, &\ K \cap K^g \cong \mathrm{SL}_2(5).
\end{align}
$$

Note that here *novel maximal subgroups* (or, *novelties*) of $H \cong \mathrm{Alt}_2.2$ are detected.


Back to the construction of $A_2.2 \le G_2$, we note that $W(G_2(p)) \cong W(G_2)$ and the Weyl group $W$ of $G$ is cotained in an $A_2.2$-type subgroup of $G$, which is not contained in any $A_2$-type subgroup. Thus we could generated an $A_2.2$ as $\langle K, W\rangle$. For this, we want to find the representatives of $W \cong N_G(T)/T$.
Note that the normaliser $H = N_G(T)=\langle n_\alpha(t)|\alpha \in \Phi, t \in \mathrm{GF}(p)^\times\rangle$, where $\Phi$ is the root system of $G$ with respect to the maximal torus $T$.
The *extended Weyl group* $V=\langle n_\alpha(1)|\alpha \in \Phi\rangle$ of $G$ satisfies that $H = \langle V, T \rangle$ and the name comes from the fact that $V/V \cap T \cong W$. In particular, $V \cong W.(V \cap T)$, where $V \cap T$ is isomorphic to an elementary abelian group of order $\ell^{\mathrm{rk}|(G)|}$, with $\ell = \gcd(2, p-1)$. In Magma, the Normaliser function is inefficient for large matrix group like this, so we try to construct *extended Weyl group* $V$ of $G$; see also [Notation 2.1] in Späth’s 2010 paper *Sylow $d$-tori of classical groups and the McKay conjecture, I*.


(**Novel maximal subgroups:** Let $G$ be an almost simple group, and $M$ a maximal subgroup of $G$, if $S \cap M$ is not maximal in $S \le G$, then $M$ is a novel maximal subgroup of $G$.)

**How do we know these are all of the possible intersections up to isomorphism/conjugacy?**
In general, if $S$ is a subgroup of $G$, then if $g_1 \in S g_2 K$, then $S \cap S^{g_1}$ and $K \cap S^{g_2}$ are conjugate. It is straightforward to see this: by choice we know there are $s_1, s_2 \in S$ such that $g_1 = s_1 g_2 s_2$,
and so $S \cap S^{g_2} = S \cap S^{s_1 g_2 s_2} = S \cap S^{g_2 s_2} = (S \cap S^{g_2})^{s_2}$.
In particular, this implies that if two intersections $S \cap S^{g_1}$, $S \cap S^{g_2}$ are not conjugate, then $S g_1 S \cap K g_2 S$ is empty.

We have seen from above five different isomorphism types of intersections, for each case $H \cap H^g$ we can easily calculate the cardinality $|H g H| = \frac{|H|^2}{|H \cap H^g|}$. Since these are all disjoint double cosets, if $\sum_{g \in I} |H g H| = |G|$, then we know that we have exhausted all possible intersections by considering $H \cap H^g$ for all such $g \in I$, up to conjugacy.
A quick computation shows that this is indeed the case in our example $G_2(5)$ when we have

$$
I = \{ 1_G, x_{\alpha}(1),\
x_{\alpha + \beta}(1)x_{2\alpha + \beta}(1),\
x_{\alpha + \beta}(1)x_{-\alpha - \beta}(1),\
x_{\alpha + \beta}(1)x_{-\alpha - \beta}(2) \}
$$

as above.
Moreover, we compute and see that for $p = 3, 7, 11$,
let $H = \langle X_{\pm\beta}, X_{\pm (3\alpha + \beta)}, X_{\pm(3\alpha + 2\beta)}\rangle$,
then there are $\frac{1}{2}(p + 5)$ classes of intersections $H \cap H^g$ with $g \in G = G_2(p)$.
For example,

$$
\begin{align}
  &g = 1, & H \cap H^g = H, \\
  &g = x_{\alpha}, & H \cap H^g \cong p \rtimes \mathrm{Dih}_p. \mathrm{Alt}_p,\\
  &g = x_{\alpha + \beta}(1)x_{2\alpha + \beta}(1), & H \cap H^g \cong \mathrm{He}(p).2,\\
  &g = x_{\alpha + \beta}(1)x_{-\alpha - \beta}(1), & H \cap H^g \cong \mathrm{SL}_2(p).2,\\
  &g = x_{\alpha + \beta}(1)x_{-\alpha - \beta}(s), & H \cap H^g \cong 4.\mathrm{PSL}_2(p) \mbox{ or } 2.\mathrm{PSL}_2(p).2,\\
  &g = x_{\alpha + \beta}(1)x_{-\alpha - \beta}(\frac{1}{2}(p - 1)), & H \cap H^g \cong 4.\mathrm{PSL}_2(p).2,
\end{align}
$$

where $s = 2, \dots, \frac{1}{2}(p - 3)$ (*check this actually gives nonconjugate intersections!!*).

Sizewise, the sum $\sum_{g \in I} |H g H|$ does add up to $|G|$, and the sizes of these intersections $H \cap H^g$ agree with the results of Bannai–Song–Yamada (2008, *Character tables of the association schemes coming from the action of $G_2(q)$ on hyperplanes of type $O^\epsilon(q)$*). However, observe that there are $\frac{1}{2}(p - 3)$ congjugacy classes of the intersections that have the same size, and we observed from MAGMA results that there are two isomorphism types amongst these. We yet need to check that the intersections we have found are actually nonconjugate and/or determine how many of them are isomorphic to $4.\mathrm{PSL}_2(p)$ and how many $2.\mathrm{PSL}_2(p).2$.
One check we should perform is to compare the double cosets $HxH$, since we know that if $H \cap H^x$ and $H \cap H^{x'}$ are conjugate then $HxH \cap Hx'H = \varnothing$.
Also, notice that in all of these $\frac{1}{2}(p - 3)$ cases the intersections $H_0 \cap H_0^g$ are all isomorphic to $2.\mathrm{PSL}_2(p)$, where $H_0$ is the maximal subgroup of type $A_2$ generated by the long roots in $H$.

**Things to look into**

- As mentioned above, it is worth looking into the intersections of the subgroups of type $A_2$ as well, since they are normal and maximal in $H$.
- Comparing the intersections $H \cap H^g$ and $H_0 \cap H_0^g$,
  - we see that in the case where $g = x_\alpha(1)$, the intersections coincide and are isomorphic to $p \rtimes \mathrm{Dih}_p. \mathrm{PSL}_2(p)$. Recall that this is true whenever $g$ centralises a root of $H$.
  - in the case where $g = x_{\alpha+\beta}(1)x_{-\alpha-\beta}(\frac{1}{2}(p - 1))$, the intersection $H \cap H^g \cong 2.(H_0 \cap H_0^g).2$.
  - in all other cases $H \cap H^g \cong (H_0 \cap H_0^g).2$.
- In the cases where $X = H \cap H^g$ and $X^g$ are $H$-conjugate, we know that it is possible to find $g' \in N_H(X)$ such that $X = H \cap H^{g'}$. How can we make use of this?
- Novelties.
- Use MAGMA to compute double cosets $H g H$?
- What about other odd primes and prime powers, do we still have these intersections? The general idea is that for a subgroup we recognise as an intersection in the finite group senario, we want to show that there are no larger subgroups containing it that can be an intersection of conjugate maximal subgroups of $G_2$.




## Useful general results
For us to recognise some subgroups of $G_2(q)$, it is useful to know some special numbers coming from subgroup orders. First of all, the order of $G_2(q)$ is $q^6(q^6-1)(q^2-1)$, and a subgroup of type $A_2(q).2$ has index $\frac{1}{2}(q^6 + q^3)$ in $G_2(q)$, as $A_2(q)$ has order $q^3(q^3-1)(q^2-1)$.

We know that there are 6 conjugacy classes of maximal tori corresponding to the 6 conjugacy classes

$$
\{[1], [-1], [r_{\frac{\pi}{3}}], [r_{\frac{2\pi}{3}}], [s_{\alpha}], [s_{\beta}]\}
$$

of the Weyl group $W \cong \mathrm{Dih}_6$.

Up to isomorphism, these finite maximal tori are $C_{q - 1}^2, C_{q + 1}^2, C_{q^2 - q + 1}, C_{q^2 + q + 1}, C_{q^2 - 1}, C_{q^2 - 1}$, respectively.

### Base sizes
Let $H$ be a maximal subgroup of a finite group $G$ and let $H_G = \cap_{g \in G} H^g$ be the core of $H$, so we can view $G/H_G$ as a primitive permutation group on the set $\Omega = G/H$ of cosets of $H$ in $G$.
Then a subset $B$ of $\Omega$ is a *base* for $G/H_G$ if the pointwise stabiliser of $B$ in $G/H_G$ is trivial, and we define the base size of $G$, denoted $b(G,H)$, to be the minimal size of a base. Equivalently,

$$
b(G,H)=\min\{|S| : S \subseteq G,  \cap_{g \in S} H^g =H_G\}.
$$
