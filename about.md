# About myself

Good day! I am a second-year PhD student under the supervision of [Dr Adam Thomas](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/thomas/) (Warwick) and [Dr Heiko Dietrich](https://users.monash.edu/~heikod/) (Monash) and am funded by the [Monash Warwick Alliance Joint PhD program](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/dc/policies_guidance/student_mobility/jointphd). My current project focuses on finite groups of Lie type with broad interests in the computational aspects, linear algebraic groups and representation theory for groups.

**Contact:** eileen.pan@warwick.ac.uk

**MPhil thesis:** [Groups of small order type](https://github.com/xpan-eileen/sotgrps_gap_pkg/blob/master/Thesis_Groups_of_small_order_type.pdf).

**Publications:** Heiko Dietrich, Bettina Eick, and Xueyu Pan. Groups whose orders factorise into at most four primes. J. Symb. Comp. 108, 23-40 (2022). *[pdf](https://github.com/xpan-eileen/sotgrps_gap_pkg/blob/master/Dietrich%2C%20Eick%2C%20Pan%2C%202022.pdf)* (Complementary GAP package SOTGrps can be found [here](https://github.com/xpan-eileen/sotgrps_gap_pkg).)

**CV:** [CV.pdf](About%20myse%20ffeb5/CV.pdf)

I see myself as a mathsperson and feminist, but I have many other interests as well. I keep a brief journal of the books I have read and theatrical performances I have seen.
